/-  Written by `gabbro pflichten --lean`. Do not edit -- the source is the
    `.gab`, and a second register over the same thing is the very class this
    folder is written against.

    Every obligation of the register appears below: CARRIED by a theorem of
    this unit, ASSUMED (hardware, foreign code -- named in `Assumed`), or
    REFUSED by name. The line that has to add up:

        @duty 1  beispiele/gift/654-a-compound-assignment-to-a-port-register.gab  total 0  goals 0  refused 0
        @assumed 0  of the refused are ASSUMPTIONS -- hardware, foreign code -- and 0 are refused forms

    The meaning of a body is `Gabbro.Body`, written by hand and read by a
    person. What stands here is a DATUM of it -- this file defines nothing.

    WHAT A PERSON OWES: the `_statement` of every `_meets` and every `_keeps`
    theorem below. Each is proved by `gabbro_auto`, which closes what the
    model closes by computation and leaves a `sorry` on the rest -- and the
    rest is, by construction, the program's own logic: every hypothesis the
    proof can need stands in front of the turnstile. A person proves the
    statement in a file of their own and hands it to `unit_closed`.

    WHAT THE GENERATOR OWES, AND PAYS: the composition over every call
    (`Contract`, `Frame`), the rule of every loop (`LoopRule`), the
    precondition at every call site (the call gets stuck without it), and
    the wiring from the duties to the contracts (`unit_closed`).

    ASSUMED, and visible because it is written down: two different carrier
    names are two different objects (the alias passes carry it), and two
    objects of one record type are ONE object of the model (a record's
    places are named by its type, as a table's are); the
    declared `effects` list is complete (`E008`/`E010`, `Frame` in `Program`);
    the initial world satisfies every invariant (a statement about `boot`,
    booked by no register); and everything `Assumed` names.

    `Program ρ` says the environment runs the bodies of this unit. From it and
    the duty statements, `unit_closed` yields every contract and every loop rule
    -- in dependency order, so that no person writes the induction over the
    call graph or over the passes of a loop. -/
