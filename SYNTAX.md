### Flat record embedding

A record body may contain `..Name`, for example
`type Body = { ..Pos, mass: f64, };`. Embedded fields precede the record's
own fields, preserving embedding order and each embedded record's field order.
Their types and field metadata are retained. Literals and field access use the
resulting flat field names; embedding introduces no conversion or subtyping.
Duplicate field names, non-record targets and recursive embeddings are refused
with named `record embedding` errors. Existing restrictions on field metadata
remain enforced by the record exporter after expansion.

### Finite folds and boolean existence

```ebnf
primary    += foldexpr | existsexpr ;
foldexpr    = ( "add" | "min" | "max" ) ident "in" domain
              [ "where" pred ] ":" expr [ "else" expr ] ;
existsexpr  = "exists" ident "in" domain ":" pred ;
```

```gabbro
let open_sum = add k in slots of Orders where Orders[k].open : Orders[k].amount;
let best = min k in slots of Jobs : Jobs[k].latency else 0;
let worst = max k in slots of Jobs : Jobs[k].latency else 0;
let failed = true && (exists k in slots of Jobs : Jobs.slots[k].failed);
```

A fold traverses one finite table domain using an internal accumulator. The
existing slot, tree and fixed-array domain exporters determine its iteration
order and membership. The binder is in scope in the filter and element
expression; the `else` expression uses the surrounding scope. Generated local
names cannot collide with source identifiers. An element is evaluated once per
selected slot, after its filter succeeds. Access guards and ordinary expression
checks apply throughout; reading another table in the filter or element is
refused.

`add` starts at zero and forbids `else`. Its integer interval is capacity times
the element interval, including zero when fewer slots can be selected. A result
outside the result type is refused with `fold: result range does not fit its
integer type; narrow the operand first`. A fold never wraps. `min` and `max`
require `else`; the first selected element initializes the result, subsequent
elements update the extremum, and the fallback is evaluated only if no element
was selected. The fallback does not participate in a nonempty reduction.

An OPEN table has no finite fold capacity and is refused. Missing extrema
fallbacks, an `else` on `add`, unsupported domains and second-table reads are
named refusals. Float operands are parsed, but currently refused as
`fold: IEEE float value export is not available`: the existing source exporter
has no IEEE value reader. The planned float `add` is ordered by slot, without
reassociation; integer folding does not substitute for it.

`exists` is an ordinary boolean expression, including in a binding, condition,
boolean operator or return. It elaborates through the existing predicate
exporter to the canonical `Expr.existsSlots`, equivalent to leaving a traversal
on the first matching slot. It introduces no source interpreter or new G form.
Fold costs use the existing traversal and statement cost computation: capacity
times the per-slot work, including filter and update, plus loop and binding
overhead. These syntax extensions do not change the model's guarantees.
